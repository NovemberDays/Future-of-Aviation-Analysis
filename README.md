# Future-of-Aviation-Analysis
This is our simple analysis of our IPAT model. The JupyterNotebook file contains:
- Calculations / simulations of our IPAT through time from 2025 to 2050.
- Reduction of Vkm needed to meet reduced CO2e emission in 2050 from current technology, i.e. 99.7% of kerosene aircraft and 0.03% biofuel.
- Relevant plots produced and used in the report.
- Stranded assets simulation.
